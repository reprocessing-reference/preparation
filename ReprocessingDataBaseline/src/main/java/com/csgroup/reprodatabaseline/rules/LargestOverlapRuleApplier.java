    This mode gets the file (only one) that satisfies both the following conditions:
    * covers entirely time interval interval [t0 - dt0 , t1 + dt1]
    * has got the largest overlap.
    Basically the outcomes of this mode is the same as the following sequence is applied:
    * Get files with ValCover mode
    * Among the returned files select the one with the largest overlap.
    If there are several products with the same overlap (e.g. full coverage), the product with the start time that is closest to TOTO
    is chosen. Note that in the full coverage case the result is identical to "ValCoverClosest".
